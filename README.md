## Chrome extension - Boycott western brands that have refused to exit Russian market

- Currently in MVP stage - targeting only Nestlé. 
- This extension highlights products and brands owned by the brands in the online stores of [Tesco.ie](https://www.tesco.ie/groceries) and [Tesco.com](https://www.tesco.com/groceries). It displays a warning message so you can boycott them (see screenshots below).
- By refusing to leave the Russian market, these brands are implicitely supporting the war in Ukraine.
